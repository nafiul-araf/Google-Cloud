# Google-Cloud

This repository contains projects implemented on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), showcasing diverse use cases for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization. The projects leverage GCP's powerful suite of tools, including SQL for querying and managing data with BigQuery, Python for data processing and machine learning, and dashboards for interactive data visualization using tools like Looker Studio. GCP's advanced capabilities, such as scalable cloud storage, serverless computing, and integrated machine learning services, enable efficient handling of large-scale datasets and end-to-end data-driven solutions.
